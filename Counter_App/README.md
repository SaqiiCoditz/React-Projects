# 🚀 React Counter App

A simple and interactive **Counter App** built with **React + Vite + TailwindCSS**.  
This app allows you to increment, decrement, and reset a counter with a custom step size. It also prevents values from going below `0` or above `100` with warning messages.

---

## ✨ Features

- ➕ **Increment** the counter by a custom step size.

- ➖ **Decrement** the counter safely (no negative values).

- 🔄 **Reset** the counter back to zero.

- ⚠️ Warning messages when:
  - Trying to exceed the maximum value (`100`).
  - Trying to go below the minimum value (`0`).

- 🎨 Styled with **TailwindCSS** for a clean and modern UI.
